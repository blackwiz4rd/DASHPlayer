# DASHPlayer
A simple Java implementation of a DASH client for video streaming developed for my Bachelor's degree final exam.
A python server was added to allow developers to test their algorithms.

# Dependencies
All libraries are located in the ```lib/``` folder, link them to your IDE (This project was built with IntelliJ, so you don't need to do it if you use this IDE).
For IntelliJ users, set project language level to "9" in "Project Structure | Project" and "Project SDK" to JDK.
%For IntelliJ users, edit configurations and add two applications to run both TesterTrainer and Player main classes, also add a compund. Only with older version (TesterTrainer was used for testing only).
The video player is based on [VLCJ](https://github.com/caprica/vlcj) that uses LibVLC, install the VLC application to get it.

To activate DDASH algorithm you need to start the Learning agent:
```sh
sh start_agent.sh
```

To install dependencies for ``src/python_lib/Agent.py`` and ``src/server/manage.py``run
```chmod +x setup.sh```
```sh setup.sh```

# Server side
To start the server run:
```sh start_server.sh```
In ```src/server/media/``` static video content is stored.
